This is a basic Express server to serve as an API endpoint to simulate creating, reading, updating, and deleting articles from a database with a small network delay.

Used the following commands from https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html to generate this app
```
npm install express-generator -g
express -v twig -c sass
(You could use a different view engine or CSS language if you prefer.)
```
